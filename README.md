# Blah Blah

Automatic folding/unfolding for Python docstrings.

## Features

This extension adds two new commands to the command pallette when editing `.py` files:
- `Fold Docstrings`: Folds all of the docstrings in the current `.py` file.
- `Unfold Docstrings`: Unfolds all of the docstrings in the current `.py` file.

That's it.
